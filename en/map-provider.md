# Does findx use an external map provider?
Yes, findx uses an exteral map provider, or actual several. But this does not compromise your privacy.

## The map data
Findx uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM), a crowdsourced map of the world, for its map data. Similar to Wikipedia, anyone can [contribute to OpenStreetMap](https://help.findx.com/en/contribute-map).

## The look of findx maps
In addition, findx customizes the mapâ€™s design and displays graphics with [Scout](http://developer.skobbler.com).

## Route directions on findx
Finally, [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com) provides routing directions for the findx service.
