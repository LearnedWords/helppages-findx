# Does findx use an external map provider?
findx uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM), a crowdsourced map of the world, for its map data. Similar to Wikipedia, anyone can [contribute to OpenStreetMap](https://help.findx.com/en/contribute-map).


In addition, findx customizes the mapâ€™s design and displays graphics with [Scout](http://developer.skobbler.com).


Finally, [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com) provides routing directions for the findx service.
