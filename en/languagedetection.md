# How is my prefered search result language set?  

To show relevant results when you search, findx tries to guess what language you prefer to see results in. 

This is done by a combination of looking at what language your browsers is set to use and your geographical location.

***Example: You are in London, and prefers UK results.***  

Your browser is set to English, but English results can be from all over the world. To help you get relevant search results findx use a service to translate your IP address to a country, UK.  

This way findx guess your prefers English results from UK and improves the result to match that combination.

Feel free to set your own preffered settings.

Geographical location (country) is done before you search findx, and based on your browser language and geographical location. findx doesn't know or save your IP address.
