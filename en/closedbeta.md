#What is findx closed beta access?
Beta access to findx means that you will experience findx  while it is being build - The Privacore team knows there is a lot of work to do before we are ready to a public release, but we want to let users follow the progress while we are building the new real internet search engine from Europe.

##What can I expect as a beta user?
findx is not fully developed, and you can not yet be sure to find whatever you are looking for.

###Missing search results
You might ask  

- Why is my website not listed? or 
+ On Google I find this result, why is it not on findx?

Results in a search engine requires the search engine robot actually visits a website site, you can imagine it will take a while before findxbot visits all important sites on the internet. 

###Variation in perfomance and speed  
You may also experience performance can vary when, this happens due to the hard work and continues updates from the development team - and from time to time findx will even be unavailable.
 
##Start searching and improving the web in private
Findx beta gives you access to search the web in private, and will not collect your personal behaviour or search history.

###Available services in beta 
All of these searches are available to you right now – but off course still in beta while the Privacore team improves them!  

* Web search
* Map search and route planning
* Shopping search
* Image and Video search

##Help improve search results 
We believe you know a lot about the what is good and not so good on the web. That is why you can help other “finders” to get better results, and why you as an users can give feedback directly in the search results.

We are looking forward to hear your thoughts on this, so keep an eye out because it will soon be ready for you as a beta user.
