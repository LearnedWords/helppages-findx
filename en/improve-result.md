# Improve a Result

The information findx returns about a Web page is only as good as what the webmaster enters. At times, you may encounter very general page titles and descriptions that don't tell you much. You can help make findx better by improving the title and description of a result.

To do this:

1. Click on the **"comment" icon** that appears to the far right of the result. The Improve on this result dialog will open.
2. Under "How could the title for this result be better?," edit the title, if necessary.
3. Under "What will describe the content of this result better?,", edit the description, if necessary. 

What happens after this?????????
