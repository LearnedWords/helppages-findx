# Why store a cookie that remembers your settings?

Cookies are small files that store your site preferences and history. Websites save cookies onto your computer so that when you return, you can pick up where you left off. 


findx saves a cookie (a file called findx.com) that remembers your site preferences only - not your history. This makes it easier for you to use the service. 


For example, the cookie will remember your language settings, whether you want to open the results you select in a new tab, and more.


To learn more about findx and privacy, see the [Privacore Privacy Promise](https://www.privacore.com/privacy-promise/).
