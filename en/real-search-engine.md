# findx - A truly private search engine
findx is a unique, privacy-focused search engine that respects your anonymity. Unlike other privacy-oriented sites, we built our search engine ourselves.

## Search engine basics
Like all search engines, findx uses a crawler (a “spider” or “bot”) that visits Web pages, then stores information about them in an index. When you submit a query, algorithms compare your search against the index, and rank the results they find by evaluating the page title, links on the page, links to the page, creation date, and other page attributes. 

## Private vs. standard search engines
Most search engines save your history, location, device, and many other things about you, and  use this data to personalize the results you see. Google has been applying this type of “[Filter Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble)" since 2009. 


Because most search engines consider your personal history when ranking pages, different people will get different results, even when they search for the same thing. In addition, search providers often sell your data to their advertisers.

## How is a private search engine different?
Private search engines like findx allow you to search anonymously. They won’t save your search history, use cookies, or collect your behaviour so they can can correlate it with your other online activities.

## What is a metasearch engine, and how does it differ from other search engines?
A metasearch engine aggregates data from other search engines. Rather than using its own crawlers and index, it sends your query to third party sites, then gathers and presents the results. They typically buy results from several different external search engines, then search across all of them at once.


Metasearch engines can also offer private searches. The best known privacy-oriented search engines are meta-search engines.

## findx is a real, free, private search engine
findx is a free search engine from Europe that maintains its own crawler and index. We’re committed to your privacy. The findx service will never know anything about you. In fact, the way we built findx makes recording your data technically impossible. When you use findx, you’ll have complete control over who sees your online activity. We promise not to share your history or behaviour with anyone else.
